# User Bio Data Persistence Implementation

## Overview

This document explains how user bio data persistence is implemented in the wallet application using AsyncStorage to enhance the user experience by maintaining user profile information across app sessions.

## How It Works

### 1. AsyncStorage Integration
- **Storage**: User profile data is stored locally using `AsyncStorage` (React Native's equivalent to localStorage)
- **Key**: Profile data is stored under the key `'userProfile'`
- **Format**: Data is serialized as JSON for storage and deserialized when retrieved

### 2. Data Flow

#### On App Start
1. **Load Cached Data**: The app first attempts to load cached profile data from AsyncStorage
2. **Display Cached Data**: If cached data exists, it's immediately displayed to the user
3. **Fetch Fresh Data**: The app then fetches fresh data from Firebase Firestore
4. **Update Cache**: Fresh data replaces the cached data in AsyncStorage

#### On Login
1. **Fetch Profile**: When a user logs in, their profile is fetched from Firestore
2. **Store Locally**: The profile data is stored in AsyncStorage for future use
3. **Update State**: The profile state is updated with the fresh data

#### On Profile Updates
1. **Update Firestore**: Profile changes are saved to Firestore
2. **Refresh Cache**: The entire profile is re-fetched and cached
3. **Update State**: The UI is updated with the new data

#### On Logout
1. **Clear Cache**: All cached profile data is removed from AsyncStorage
2. **Clear State**: The profile state is reset to null
3. **Sign Out**: Firebase authentication sign out is performed

## Key Components

### AuthContext.tsx
- **loadCachedProfile()**: Loads cached profile data on app initialization
- **fetchProfile()**: Fetches profile from Firestore and caches it
- **signOut()**: Clears cached data on logout
- **updateProfile()**: Updates profile and refreshes cache

### AsyncStorage Operations
```typescript
// Store profile data
await AsyncStorage.setItem('userProfile', JSON.stringify(profileData));

// Retrieve profile data
const cachedProfile = await AsyncStorage.getItem('userProfile');
const parsedProfile = JSON.parse(cachedProfile);

// Clear profile data
await AsyncStorage.removeItem('userProfile');
```

## User Experience Benefits

### 1. Faster App Loading
- Users see their profile data immediately on app start
- No waiting for network requests to load basic information

### 2. Offline Capability
- Profile data is available even when offline
- Basic app functionality works without internet connection

### 3. Reduced Login Prompts
- Combined with Firebase Auth persistence, users stay logged in
- Profile data persists across app restarts

### 4. Seamless Experience
- No loading screens for profile data on subsequent app opens
- Smooth transitions between app sessions

## Security Considerations

### 1. Local Storage Security
- AsyncStorage data is stored locally on the device
- Data is not encrypted by default (consider encryption for sensitive data)
- Data is cleared on logout for security

### 2. Data Synchronization
- Cached data is always refreshed from Firestore on login
- Ensures data consistency between local and remote storage
- Handles cases where profile data may have changed on other devices

### 3. Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if AsyncStorage operations fail
- App continues to function even if caching fails
- Console logging for debugging cache operations

## Debugging

### Console Logs
The implementation includes detailed console logging:
- `üì± Loaded cached profile data`: When cached data is successfully loaded
- `üóëÔ∏è Cleared cached profile data on logout`: When cache is cleared on logout
- Error logs for AsyncStorage operations

### Testing Cache Operations
```typescript
// Check if profile data is cached
const cachedData = await AsyncStorage.getItem('userProfile');
console.log('Cached profile:', cachedData);

// Clear cache manually (for testing)
await AsyncStorage.removeItem('userProfile');
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Cache Not Loading**
   - Check if AsyncStorage is properly imported
   - Verify the storage key is correct (`'userProfile'`)
   - Check console for error messages

2. **Data Not Persisting**
   - Ensure AsyncStorage operations are awaited
   - Check if the device has sufficient storage space
   - Verify the data structure matches the Profile interface

3. **Cache Not Clearing on Logout**
   - Ensure signOut function is called properly
   - Check if AsyncStorage.removeItem is awaited
   - Verify the storage key matches

### Performance Considerations

1. **Storage Size**
   - Profile data is relatively small
   - AsyncStorage has reasonable limits for this use case
   - Monitor storage usage if profile data grows significantly

2. **Memory Usage**
   - Cached data is loaded into memory on app start
   - Consider lazy loading for large profile datasets
   - Clear cache when memory pressure is detected

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Data Encryption
- Implement encryption for sensitive profile data
- Use react-native-keychain for secure storage of sensitive fields

### 2. Selective Caching
- Cache only essential profile fields
- Implement cache expiration for non-critical data

### 3. Background Sync
- Implement background data synchronization
- Update cache when app comes to foreground

### 4. Cache Invalidation
- Implement smart cache invalidation strategies
- Clear cache when profile data is significantly outdated
