# PayFlow Verification System Guide

## 🎯 Overview

The PayFlow app now includes a comprehensive identity verification system that ensures secure and compliant money transfers. Users must complete email verification and identity verification before accessing full app features.

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### 1. User Registration
1. **Sign Up**: User creates account with email, password, full name, and phone number
2. **Email Verification**: Verification email is automatically sent to user's email address
3. **Account Creation**: Basic profile is created in Firestore with `isVerified: false`
4. **Redirect**: User is redirected to sign-in page with verification instructions

### 2. Email Verification
1. **Check Email**: User must check their email and click verification link
2. **Verification Required**: Users cannot sign in until email is verified
3. **Resend Option**: Users can request new verification emails if needed

### 3. Sign In & Profile Creation
1. **Email Verification Check**: System verifies email is confirmed before allowing sign-in
2. **Profile Update**: User profile is updated with `emailVerified: true`
3. **Verification Prompt**: User is prompted to complete identity verification

## 🆔 Identity Verification Process

### Required Documents
- **Ghana National ID Card (Front)**: Clear photo of the front side
- **Ghana National ID Card (Back)**: Clear photo of the back side
- **Live Selfie**: Real-time photo taken through the app camera

### Verification Steps
1. **Upload Ghana ID**: User uploads both sides of their Ghana National ID card
2. **Take Selfie**: User takes a live selfie using the front-facing camera
3. **Submit Verification**: All documents are uploaded to Firebase Storage
4. **Review Process**: Documents are submitted for admin review
5. **Status Update**: Verification status is updated based on admin decision

### Verification Statuses
- **`pending`**: User hasn't submitted verification documents
- **`submitted`**: Documents submitted, under admin review
- **`verified`**: Identity verified, full access granted
- **`rejected`**: Verification failed, user must resubmit

## 📱 User Experience Flow

### For New Users
```
Sign Up → Email Verification → Sign In → Identity Verification → Full Access
```

### For Existing Users
```
Sign In → Check Verification Status → Complete Verification (if needed) → Full Access
```
