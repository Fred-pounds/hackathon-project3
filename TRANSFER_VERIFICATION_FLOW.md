# Transfer Verification Flow

## Overview

The PayFlow app now implements a comprehensive transfer verification system that allows senders to review recipient verification details before approving transfers. This ensures security and transparency in money transfers.

## Transfer Flow

### 1. Initiate Transfer Request
- **Sender**: Creates a transfer request by entering recipient's phone number and amount
- **Status**: Transfer request is created with status `'pending'`
- **Recipient**: Receives notification about the pending transfer request

### 2. Recipient Verification
- **Recipient**: Must complete identity verification before transfer can proceed
- **Requirements**:
  - Take a live selfie for identity verification
  - Capture current location for security purposes
- **Status**: Changes to `'verified'` when verification is complete

### 3. Sender Review
- **Sender**: Can view pending transfers in the "Pending" tab
- **Review Process**:
  - View recipient's profile information (name, phone number)
  - See recipient's verification selfie
  - View recipient's captured location
  - Review transfer amount and timestamps

### 4. Transfer Approval
- **Sender**: Approves or cancels the transfer after reviewing verification details
- **Status**: Changes to `'completed'` when approved, `'cancelled'` when declined
- **Funds**: Are transferred from sender to recipient upon approval

## Key Features

### Database Schema
```typescript
