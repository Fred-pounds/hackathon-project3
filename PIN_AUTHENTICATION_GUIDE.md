# PIN Authentication System Guide

## Overview

The PIN authentication system provides an additional layer of security for your app, requiring users to enter a 4-digit PIN for various sensitive operations.

## Features

### 🔐 **PIN Creation**
- Users create a 4-digit PIN after first sign-in
- PIN is confirmed by entering it twice
- PIN is securely hashed and stored both locally and in Firebase

### 🔒 **PIN Verification**
- Required on app restart
- Required before making payments (deposits, sending money)
- Required for PIN management operations

### 🚫 **Security Features**
- Maximum 3 failed attempts before temporary lockout
- 5-minute lockout period after failed attempts
- PIN is never stored in plain text
- Secure hashing with salt

## How It Works

### 1. **First-Time Setup**
```
User signs in → PIN creation screen → Enter PIN → Confirm PIN → PIN stored → Access granted
```

### 2. **App Restart**
```
App opens → Check if user has PIN → If yes, show PIN verification → If correct, access granted
```

### 3. **Payment Operations**
```
User initiates payment → PIN verification modal → Enter PIN → If correct, proceed with payment
```

## Key Components

### PINManager Class
- `createPIN()` - Creates new PIN
- `verifyPIN()` - Verifies PIN input
- `hasPIN()` - Checks if user has PIN
- `syncPINFromFirebase()` - Syncs PIN from cloud
- `changePIN()` - Changes existing PIN

### PINInput Component
- Custom numeric keypad
- Visual PIN dots
- Show/hide PIN option
- Error handling and animations

### PINVerificationModal
- Modal for payment operations
- Reusable across different screens
- Handles lockout states

## Usage Examples

### Creating a PIN
```typescript
const result = await PINManager.createPIN(userId, "1234");
if (result.success) {
  // PIN created successfully
} else {
  // Handle error
}
```

### Verifying a PIN
```typescript
const result = await PINManager.verifyPIN("1234");
if (result.success) {
  // PIN verified, proceed with operation
} else {
  // Handle incorrect PIN
}
```

### Checking PIN Status
```typescript
const hasPIN = await PINManager.hasPIN();
if (hasPIN) {
  // User has PIN, show verification
} else {
  // User needs to create PIN
}
```

## Security Considerations

### ✅ **What's Secure**
- PINs are hashed using SHA-256 with salt
- Failed attempts are tracked and limited
- Temporary lockout prevents brute force attacks
- PIN data is stored securely in AsyncStorage

### ⚠️ **Production Recommendations**
- Replace simple hashing with bcrypt or similar
- Implement rate limiting on PIN attempts
- Add biometric authentication as an option
- Consider hardware security modules for PIN storage

## User Experience

### **PIN Creation Flow**
1. User enters desired PIN
2. User confirms PIN
3. Success message and navigation to main app
4. PIN is now required for all sensitive operations

### **PIN Verification Flow**
1. User attempts sensitive operation
2. PIN verification modal appears
3. User enters PIN
4. If correct, operation proceeds
5. If incorrect, error message and retry

### **Lockout Handling**
1. After 3 failed attempts, account is locked
2. Countdown timer shows remaining lockout time
3. User cannot attempt PIN entry during lockout
4. After lockout period, attempts reset

## Integration Points

### **Deposit Screen**
- PIN verification required before opening payment gateway
- Uses PINVerificationModal component

### **Send Money Screen**
- PIN verification required before money transfer
- Uses PINVerificationModal component

### **Profile Screen**
- PIN management options (change, view info)
- Security section with PIN controls

### **App Navigation**
- Automatic routing based on PIN status
- PIN creation for new users
- PIN verification for returning users

## Error Handling

### **Common Error Scenarios**
- User forgets PIN → Contact support
- Too many failed attempts → Temporary lockout
- PIN creation failure → Retry with different PIN
- Network issues → Fallback to local storage

### **User Recovery Options**
- Cancel PIN setup → Sign out
- Cancel PIN verification → Return to previous screen
- Lockout → Wait for timer to expire
- Support contact → Manual PIN reset

## Testing

### **Test Scenarios**
1. First-time PIN creation
2. PIN verification on app restart
3. PIN verification for payments
4. Failed PIN attempts and lockout
5. PIN change functionality
6. PIN sync across devices

### **Edge Cases**
- Network connectivity issues
- App backgrounding during PIN entry
- Device rotation during PIN input
- Memory pressure scenarios

## Future Enhancements

### **Planned Features**
- Biometric authentication integration
- PIN recovery via email/SMS
- Multiple PIN support for different operations
- PIN strength requirements
- PIN expiration policies

### **Security Improvements**
- Hardware-backed PIN storage
- Advanced encryption algorithms
- Multi-factor authentication
- Risk-based authentication

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**
- PIN not being recognized → Check PIN format and storage
- Lockout not working → Verify attempt tracking
- PIN sync failures → Check Firebase connectivity
- Component not rendering → Verify imports and dependencies

### **Debug Information**
- Development mode shows PIN status
- Console logs for PIN operations
- Error messages for failed operations
- PIN attempt tracking in AsyncStorage

## Conclusion

The PIN authentication system provides a robust security layer that enhances user protection while maintaining a smooth user experience. It's designed to be secure, user-friendly, and easily extensible for future security enhancements.
